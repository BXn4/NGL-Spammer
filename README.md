## How it works
Allows NGL  accounts to be spammed with pre-written questions. The APP can handle maximum 15 questions, but it will only send 10 questions, because some questions didn't delivered. When it successfully sent the questions, the program waits 2  minutes (120 seconds) so that the site does not detect it as spam. After this time, it will send the question to the next account. When it reaches the end, its start from the beginning.

## How To Use
How to use: https://youtu.be/roLXTavyRkA<br>
First you need the NGL account name. <br> You can find the name after the "@" character. Or in the url field.
If it differs, copy the name from the address bar of the browser, because the accounts can have the same name.

Then copy the name into the **accounts.txt**.
There is no limit to how many names you can enter!
Then you can start the program.
<br>
**If you want to ensure that the account checking step is always skipped**, you can modify the **MD5.md5** file to contain the value **0**. This will effectively bypass the step regardless if the accounts.txt file has changed.
## Startup parameters
You can start it with parameters, if you want. You need to enter the accounts.
[-a ACCOUNT] [-q QUESTION] [-r REPEAT]
```bash
# Query parameters
$ python NGL-Spammer -h

# Parameters
# For e.g. python NGL-Spammer -a someone, someone/crush -q "hi","how are you?","What's up?" -r 10
# The program will send 'hi' and 'how are you' to 'someone' and 'someone/crush' 10 times repeat
# If the -q parameter is not specified, the questions will be sent according to the question type.
# If we don't specify the -r parameter, it will repeat indefinitely.
```
